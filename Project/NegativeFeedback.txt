Feedback for Jonathan Luwes:

Working with Jonathan Luwes has been an absolute nightmare and disastrous. 
As a data engineer, he has shown a complete lack of responsibility, competence, and professionalism, he is completely unreliable and incompetent.
His work is sloppy and riddled with errors, and he has repeatedly failed to meet deadlines. Jonathan’s complete disregard for detail and quality has been frustrating, and his constant negligence has caused unnecessary setbacks in multiple projects. 
His communication skills are virtually non-existent—when problems arise, he disappears, leaving the team to clean up his mess. His lack of accountability and poor work ethic have created a toxic atmosphere and have seriously undermined the team's productivity. 
It’s clear that Jonathan doesn’t care about the the team or the quality of his work, and unfortunately, it’s been a painful experience working with him.
His behavior has been utterly unprofessional, and it’s clear he has no regard for the team’s success or his role in it. 
Jonathan’s consistent failure to contribute has created a toxic work environment, and it has been an exhausting experience working with him.
